# Advent of Code

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com).
Sometimes more elegant, sometimes less.
After finding a solution, I most often will not do any refactoring.
However, I sometimes may overdo the domain mapping and play with newer or relatively infrequently used language constructs (e.g. ranges, switch expressions in C#).
